// ### Task - 4
//     Explain your answers.
// What will be the result of the following codes:

// **var a = isNaN(‘11’);**

// **var a = isNaN(2 - 10);**


var a = isNaN('11');
// console.log(a);   //[output is false]

// for this case, the output is false.Because isNaN is used for judge the number which is assigned .If the input assigned part was string then it would show true as the output

var b = isNaN('bristi')
// console.log(b);       //[ output is true ]


var a = isNaN(2 - 10);
console.log(a);  // [ output is false]
//  also for this case the same method is working behind
